Integrated with GitHub Codespaces, an instant development environment that offers all the functionality of your favorite IDE without the need for any local machine setup. With GitHub Codespaces, you can get hands-on practice from any machine, at any time—all while using a tool that you’ll likely encounter in the workplace.

Each query increases at various levels of difficulty, so you can save them for yourself and reinforce what your company already has.
